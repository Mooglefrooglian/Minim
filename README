What is Minim? Minim is a simple syntax for a simple language. It's currently in a very alpha state, barely supporting the print function and string literals, but it is progressing very fast.

It uses the bsn.GoldParser library to parse source files and Reflection.Emit library on the .Net framework to generate executables that run on the CLI.

Written in C#.
